## Hi, I do have a real name — but the repos know me as **The Morning Sun**

Full-stack dev with a product brain, neon-tinted UI taste, and a healthy disrespect for flaky webhooks.  
I ship features, babysit models, and keep logs so detailed they could testify in court.

- **AI parenting:** prompt craft, fine-tuning, evals, guardrails. My models call me “mom” and ignore me like teenagers.  
- **Toolbox:** Next.js/TypeScript · React Native · Firebase (Auth/RTDB/Functions/Storage) · Stripe · AWS · Mailgun · ESP32/MicroPython/MQTT · UPS APIs  
- **Philosophy:** small PRs, ruthless scope, telemetry from day zero, tests that fail only when I deserve it.

## What I’m shipping

- **Scheduling SaaS:** confirmations, waitlist, reminders, payments — fewer empty chairs, fewer “whoops, forgot.”  
- **HealthBot:** health companion — medication calendar, smart alerts, and a face that judges your sleep.  
- **Vixter:** social+commerce platform for creators — like a mash-up of your favorite social feeds and a freelance marketplace, but with better vibes and fewer rules you didn’t ask for. *(Yes, it’s that one.)*

> All current projects are **NDA-protected**. I’d show you more, but then Legal would show *me* more, and we’re all busy.

## Personality.txt

- **Product-minded, detail-oriented, cyberpunk-friendly.** I like clean UIs with neon edges, telemetry that tells a story, and shipping that doesn’t wait for perfect.  
- **Creative + technical hybrid.** I sketch flows, design prompts, wire data, and argue with myself until the API stops crying.  
- **Hardware clause:** I have incredible ideas; my husband replies with long speeches about cables, grounding and fire hazards. I don’t do hardware — I do *“what if”*; he does *“let’s not burn the house down.”*
- **Taste:** dashboards that tell the truth, logs that read like memoirs, and a soft spot for things that go brrr (Stripe webhooks, mostly). 
- **Equestrian mode:** I’m a show-jumping athlete. My horse is “X” — short for XLR8. Yes, I do code review with helmet hair. No, X does not accept pull requests.

## AI Mom Corner

I raise models the old-fashioned way: feedback loops, consistent boundaries, and the occasional timeout behind a rate-limit.

- Prompt design & red-teaming
- Lightweight evals & regression checks (“prove it works, again”)  
- Guardrails so the UI doesn’t learn new swear words

## If you came here from LinkedIn…

That polished, responsible professional voice was marketing’s idea.
Here we talk about the interesting bits — away from the HR fun police and the eternal quest for “culture fit”.

## Availability

My freelance era is over.  
**However**: if your project is so outrageously good that it makes me forget my calendar and my therapist’s advice, I may briefly consider it. I reserve the right to ghost you for 48 hours while pretending to be heads down then reply with a full architectural diagram.

## Contact

If you need to contact me, **please don’t**.  
(But if you must, open an issue. I’ll pretend I didn’t see it and then respond suspiciously fast.)

> May your pipelines pass, your retries back off politely, and your models learn from their mistakes (for once).
